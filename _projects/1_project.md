In this project, short-term pushout tests were performed on LVL/GLT beam to CLT slab joints (with
coach screw shear connectors) to characterise the load-slip, peak load, and failure mode
of the joints.Furthermore, material tests were conducted on timber and the screws, and
the results were used to build a versatile beam on inelastic foundation finite element (FE)
model and predict the full range load-slip response of the TTC joints.

To assess the long-term performance of the TTC system, twelve TTC joints and eight
full-scale TTC beams were fabricated by connecting LVL/GLT beams to CLT slabs. The
TTC joints and beams were subjected to sustained (constant) loads and monitored under
an indoor uncontrolled environment for over 500 days. The test results revealed the major
influence of the CLT slab thickness and orientation (crosswise or lengthwise), shear
connector types/sizes and CLT slab continuity (segmentation) on the long-term
performance of the TTC joints and beams. 

Lastly, a 3D fully coupled finite element (FE) model implemented as user-defined subroutines in ABAQUS/Standard was
validated against the TTC joints and beams long-term test results and accordingly input
parameters for long-term FE simulations of the LVL-CLT and GLT-CLT composites
(with screw shear connectors) are recommended.

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
