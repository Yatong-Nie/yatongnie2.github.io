## Drivers/Background
Digital Twin is not only a digital replication of a physical asset, it is a way beyond that. Digital twin is the data 
that supercharges its value. 

Transport for NSW (TfNSW) launched the Digital of Engineering (DE) Framework in September 2018, there have been a series
of releases. The [latest version](https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/digital-engineering/digital-engineering-framework-0) is published in December 2022. 
According to the DE framework, it provides a clear specification as to the information to be included in the BIM model.
And the model property check templated is provided.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Model Property Check.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

</div>

Therefore, there is a high demand for us to use an effective tool to audit the properties in BIM models which can be used 
further to analyse or predict future.


## Method 1: Properties+ | Navisworks

Step1: Create Properties template

Step2: Create Selection sets

Step3: Export properties for selected sets.



Disadvantage:
1. Manually creating properties template --- Time consuming

2. Manually creating selection sets
