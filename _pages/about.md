**There is always a better way**

As a Digital Engineer/Structural Engineer, I am focused on developing digital and sustainable solutions in civil and structural engineering. 
My interest spans multiple areas, including digital engineering, machine learning, data science, finite element modelling and timber structures. My ultimate goal is to address problems that have wide-ranging significance, develop methods that are both accessible and effective, and built intelligent systems that can improve human lives.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
